# Quantitative_research

I recently participated in JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Quantitative Research virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to work on a Quantitative Research team at JPMorgan Chase & Co. I worked on a project that involved forecasting and predictive modeling. I practiced using advanced Python code and built my data analysis and modeling skills in a real-world context.
